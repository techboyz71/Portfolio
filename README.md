**About Me**

Josue Quinonez

Thanks for stopping by! I'm a recent graduate from Florida International University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and will be starting graduate school in January 2026 where I will pursue my Master of Science in Computer Science, primarily focusing on data science and
artificial intelligence / machine learning. I consider myself to be an avid learner as I enjoy familiarzing myself with technology or practically just about anything! I believe that knowledge is the key to empowering individuals - a philosophy instilled to me by
my father. In this repository, you will find projects such as a profile management feature for a bookstore API, a machine learning model that uses a Random Forest Classifier to determine if an individual has Parkinson's Disease on behalf of a number of factors such as
jitters, shimmers, and a noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR), and perhaps my most proudest accomplishment: a medication management system in the form of a web application that allows users to manage their medications and physicians can prescribe them. Feel free to check them
out!
